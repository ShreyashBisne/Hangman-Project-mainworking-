# Hangman-Project-mainworking-
The project begins with the understanding for the entire flow for the code for which one needs to develop and understand the pseudo-code for the program.

The following is the pseudo-code that I developed for the main function of the game :0

**Step 1 : Function** display_word(word, guessed_letters):

- Initialize an empty string for the displayed word.
- For each letter in the word:
    - If the letter is in guessed_letters:
        - Add the letter to the displayed word.
    - Else:
        - Add an underscore (_) to the displayed word.
- Return the displayed word.

**Step 2 : Function** hangman():

Initiate the function by declaring variables, messages, etc.

- Print a welcome message.
- Call choose_word() to select a word to guess.
- Initialize an empty set guessed_letters.
- Set attempts to 6.

Set up the iterations that will be required to iterate through the word,attempts available and the letters guessed in each step.

**While attempts > 0:**

- Print the current word by calling display_word() with word and guessed_letters.
- Print the number of remaining attempts.
- Print the list of guessed letters (or "None" if the set is empty).

Take an input from the user in each iteration.

- Input guess from the player.
    - Convert the guess to lowercase.(Understand the importance of this step as we know that python is strict about itâ€™s cases.)

Check for correct guesses made by the user and act accordinngly.

- **If** the guess is not a single alphabetic character:
    - Print an error message and continue.
- **If** the guess is already in guessed_letters:
    - Print a message that the letter has already been guessed and continue.
- Add the guess to guessed_letters.
- **If** all letters in the word are guessed:
    - Print a congratulations message and break the loop.
- **If** the guess is in the word:
    - Print a success message.
- **Else:**
    - Print a failure message.
    - Decrement attempts by 1.
- **If** attempts reach 0:
    - Print a game-over message and reveal the word.
- **Start the game** by calling hangman().
